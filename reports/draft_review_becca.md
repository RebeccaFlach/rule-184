Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

I think it's a pretty good explanation of the basic premise. But, it might be good to mention the extension in the abstract. 
Some more explanation of how the two models work would also help understand the experiments. 

Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?
There's not a distinct methodology section that explains the details of the implementation, and that might be good to add. 
The limitation of the small data set is mentioned, but it would be good to try to find some bigger data sets to deal with this limitation. 

Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?
Graphics are needed! A visual of the different communities identified in the graph would help the report a lot. 
Some type of quantitative analysis of how well the two models performed could be good. 

Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?
It doesn't answer the original equation because the results are the opposite of expected. But the explanation of the difference is good. 

Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?
No, it is inconsistent, but well explained why. The results are more qualitative, and it might be good to have more quantitative analysis as well. 

Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?
The extension isn't really done yet. 

Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?
The extension is behind schedule, but the replication is pretty much done. 

Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guideLinks to an external site.?
It is well written and clear!

Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?
Looks good!
